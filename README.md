## Title
A Template project for making great landing pages with animations

## `WHAT` is the `MOTIVATION` behind this project?
The modern web is now based on components. Every webpage/webapp we come across are build with components. Some common examples are menu bar, search bar, navigation bar, share-ability to common social media platforms etc. Of course some of these components needs to be hooked up to bankend services to perform the desired tasks — thats another thing, but to re-create these components from scratch would be very tedious and time consuming.

Enter [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A Utility first CSS Framework for rapidly building custom designs

Where we leverage the power of pre-built components to make out webpages/webapps.

Then we take it one notch higher — even the basic webpages (i.e landing page, profile page, shopping card page) have the same properties/functionalities these days — So why not leverage the power of pre built Template pages ?!?
